const model = new markov.MarkovMachine("The village of Bramblewood sat quietly at the edge of the forest, where winding paths met the cool shadow of ancient oaks. Every morning, the sun crept over the hills, casting golden light across the mossy rooftops. The villagers began their day with the sound of distant bells, the scent of fresh bread drifting from the small bakery by the square. Children ran through cobbled streets, chasing each other past market stalls, their laughter mingling with the chatter of merchants. In Bramblewood, stories were as valuable as coins. Old Mara, the storyteller, would sit on a worn bench by the fountain, gathering listeners with a slow smile. Her tales spoke of wandering knights, mischievous forest spirits, and the great river that wound its way beyond the mountains. She claimed the river carried whispers from the sea, though no one knew if she meant it literally. Life here moved at its own pace. Farmers tended to neat rows of vegetables, blacksmiths hammered patiently in open workshops, and the innkeeper polished mugs until they shone. At dusk, lanterns lit the streets with a warm glow, and the scent of woodsmoke filled the air. Music often drifted from the tavern, where travelers shared news of faraway lands. Yet, despite its peace, Bramblewood held mysteries. Strange lights sometimes flickered deep in the forest, and on misty mornings, unfamiliar footprints could be found along the riverbank. Some said they belonged to foxes or deer; others whispered of something older. Still, the village endured, as it always had, bound together by trust, tradition, and the unspoken understanding that some questions were better left unanswered. In the heart of Bramblewood, life was a tapestry woven from simple moments, shared meals, and stories passed from one generation to the next.");
